            <h3>1. Payment and Refunds: Once payment has been sent, it is non-refundable due to the immediate commencement of work. Refunds will not be provided under any circumstances. In the event of a payment dispute, I reserve the right to employ legal services to safeguard my investment in your server and retain the funds in question.<br><br>

                2. Design Prototyping and Modifications: Upon request, designs will be prototyped, allowing for edits and modifications. However, the number of revisions and the extent of changes permitted are subject to my discretion. It is important to note that excessive revisions or extensive modifications may incur additional charges.<br><br>
                
                3. Ownership and Access to Code: While I retain ownership of all code developed, once integrated into the server, the owner gains full read-right access. The owner is allowed to sell the code, but must comply with any requests I make regarding its listing, removal, or other actions. Failure to comply may result in legal consequences. The owner acknowledges that the code remains my intellectual property, and any unauthorized distribution or reproduction is strictly prohibited.<br><br>
                
                4. Transfer of Keymaster Assets and Refunds: If a keymaster asset is transferred to me, I assume full rights over the code and property. Any requests for refunds related to the transferred asset must be directed to the original builder of the code, not to me. The owner understands that I cannot be held responsible for any issues or disputes arising from the transferred asset.<br><br>
                
                4b: By purchasing my development services package, you agree to all terms listed here.<br><br>
                
                5. Modification and Customization: I am open to modifying and customizing the code as per the owner's requirements. However, it is important to note that any modifications made by the owner will not affect my ownership of the original code. The owner agrees to provide clear and detailed instructions for any desired modifications, and I will assess the feasibility and potential impact on the code.<br><br>
                
                6. Confidentiality of Information: All information shared during the development process will be treated as confidential. I will not disclose it to any third parties without the owner's explicit consent, unless required by law. The owner acknowledges that the confidentiality of sensitive information, such as server credentials or proprietary data, is crucial for the security and integrity of their server.<br><br>
                
                7. Termination of Services: Either party has the right to terminate the development services at any time. In the event of termination, any outstanding payments for completed work will still for completed work will still be due. The owner understands that termination may result in the discontinuation of ongoing development and the delivery of incomplete features or functionalities.

                Please be aware that these terms and conditions are subject to change without prior notice. It is your responsibility to review them periodically for any updates or revisions. By continuing to engage in FiveM development services, you indicate your acceptance and understanding of these terms and conditions.</h3>
