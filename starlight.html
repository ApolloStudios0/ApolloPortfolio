        <h1>Message to Starlight Community</h1>
        
        <p>Hi Mateys!</p>

        <p>Don't worry, this isn't too long of a read.</p>

        <p>My Name is ApolloStudios, the (now) ex-lead developer of Starlight Community. I brought you all through 3.0, 3.1.1 (My personal Favorite), 3.2 & 3.5. I knowww you all loved the custom AI music ;)</p>

        <p>I woke up this morning to find I had been fired from all platforms Starlight related, banned & removed from the community, and I didn't get a chance to say goodbye!</p>

        <p>You've all been absolutely fantastic to work for, I truly appreciate some of the moments I had here. I've made connections that'll last me the rest of my career and no-matter what situations we have, no-matter the arguments we had - these days with you all were some of the highlight of my FiveM days.</p>

        <p>To have my permissions suddenly revoked & being banned from all platforms is a killer. It's removing that force of habit of checking my phone to make sure everyone's alright.</p>

        <p>Now, I'm not here to spread stuff, spin lies or anything of the such.. just me being honest with you just as I have been for the last year whilst working here. This is what I would have said in my message if I had of left myself. I don't think they wanted that message to get out, so I've resorted to posting it here.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>If you've ever wondered why bugs or your brilliant ideas are either given the A: Ignored or B: "We're not looking to do this right now" treatment, you can thank your directors. My development list was full of bugs that were annoying to encounter in-game.. but sadly if development doesn't include something about the directors or their roleplay it simply is given a "No" or pushed to the back of line. I hope you enjoy your Church MLO for that one-time use Parker, really hurts to see players like Mervin have broken import cars, or medical not receiving new drugs, or criminals have broken heists because you'd rather play your RP out and have fun, rather than thinking directly of the players. (Lets see how quickly Parker mentions Mt Chilliad, The Chameleons, or The Yacht as a comeback!)</p>
        </div>

        <p>If your RP request doesn't involve something about the directors it simply isn't approved. Your Gym business? No. Your arcade business to keep people IC? No. Your auto-shop fixing cars? No. Your Vanilla Unicorn Upgrade? No. Church MLO for the directors? YES PLEASE!</p>

        <p>I'm truly sorry it has come to this. DRZL treats, and has always treated his developers as absolute scum of the earth. I have no idea why.</p>
        
        <p>Don't take it just from me - take it from the previous development lead at Starlight too:</p>
        <div class="quote">
            <p>"I tried to explain that I know the dev side best and how to balance stuff etc etc, you know what I mean. But they wanted me to make the server exactly how they wanted exactly and unfortunately I could see all the flaws in it but I just ended up going along with it as I couldn't fight them anymore. Hope this makes it clearer but they destroyed my passion for fivem and destroyed my mental health. I bet you see tickets where they don't get their way and pull people into tickets to ask why they are doing stuff when they haven't done anything wrong. Unfortunately the top people think this way and always have to win or be better than others. They don't care about the people on the server. he said he would pay me multiple times for the stuff I did and I only ever got paid twice which amounted to under $100. I used to buy scripts and stuff all the time for the server and paid about Â£2500 into 2.0 to make it what it was and he didn't care as long as he got his patreon money and viewers on twitch. I will always tell people to stay well clear of that server as it's not a good environment to be in and the people at the top are very abusive and horrible to their community."</p>
        </div>

        <p>They took our voices away and destroyed us. Don't let the same happen to anyone else. If you don't do it for yourself, make sure it never happens for anyone else. Do it for me. I've been nothing but the nicest I could to every-one I interact with, assisting streamers for content, adding business stuff in as soon as I could (where I was allowed and not tagged saying it needs to be removed now!)</p>

        <p>They were scared of this message getting out! A little bit of fightback and you're left in the dust and they'll move on! Even from people who they held dearest! (at one point anyway). I had my admin permissions revoked at the start of the week for "Spawning in guns" "Spawning In USBs". However, as the directors don't really engage in much roleplay outside of their own crews, they didn't realize these were put into drops for the players. A group of directors (and or director friends) spawning in 6 AK47's, IFAKs for a scene with 40 players online? No problem at all dude! It doesn't make much sense. Why treat those caring for the server in such ways.</p>

        <p>You'll all likely find the server to go stale and quiet very quickly. I feel I brought an energy to the server that kept spirits high, kept people excited.. that .. that is no longer.</p>

        <p>If you aren't banned from the server, you'll be slowly cornered into giving everything up to the point you feel you have no other choice. You might even be gaslighted to think it was your own decision!</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>I doom-scrolled when I first joined the development chats:</p>
            <p>DRZL: "You're fucking up my side business"</p>
            <p>DRZL: @DrewA, @DrewA .. 20 minute pass "Fucking ridiclous on the hunt for new devs then." (Not Drew Arnold, Hammy Ya Legend.)</p>
        </div>

        <p>You weren't left with anything. No time. If it wasn't done then & there it wasn't good enough.</p>

        <p>DRZL also half-paid sometimes, something all of the other developers have faced in the past, claiming that you weren't good enough and "things were going in un-tested". It destroys your mental health. Luckily, I worked for the people right up until the point of my removal, providing assistance to the streamers. I never worked for the directors, I worked for <strong>you.</strong></p>

        <p>My DM's were always, and continue to be, open to anyone.</p>

        <p>Starlight is a corner of the FiveM community, truly ruined by it's own creation. I'm not here to say leave, nor would I ever want to destroy it, each one of my development projects is treated like a baby & I'll care for it.. and in this case that kid has grown up to be a teenager and spat at me in the face. Depsite that, it's still attached, as with all the other servers I develop for.</p>

        <p>I can see the story being spun to direct your attention away from this.. "Oh he did X" - "he did x". Okay! It's okay to let people be people. I don't need to defend myself anymore, I've let my words be words and you all way too smart to fall for all shit. You know what's real and what's not. I've never been malicious, never attacked a player (outside of the city, sorry PD! :P ), I've been open from the start and enjoy spending time with each and every one of you.</p>

        <p>So, now you've seen my name dissapear from the side of the panel I leave you with a final message:</p>
        <p>I hope you all enjoy your time here - avoid directors, keep yourself in line, don't raise a ticket, don't make too much money, don't copy what DRZL does and you'll fit in just fine. And do me a favor, make sure no developer EVER gets this treatment. It's soul destroying. Do it for them, do it for their future. Do it for you.</p>

        <p>If you ever want to contact me, my name on Discord remains the same.</p>
